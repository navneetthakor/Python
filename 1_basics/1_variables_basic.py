# declaring variables
"""
there is now way to declare ariables inside python, we can only create them at time of initilizations
"""
a = 10

# string can be created by using single, double, or tripal qouates
a = "navneet"

# multiple values assignement
a, b, c = "navneet", 1 , 3.75

# printing variagles
print(a,b,c) # spaces are added automatically
print(a + b + c) # TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
print(a + "nk") # no spacing
