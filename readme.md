# Inner working

## How python code executes
- python script -> byte code (machine independent) (.pyc file) -> Python Virtual Machine (PVM) -> final output
- PVM has one loop running which takes each file as input and produce it's output that's why we called it as `interpreted language`.
- `.pyc` will only be created in case of `import` statements are present otherwise in top-level statements this file is hidden.

## Immutable and mutable
- mutables are those whose references can't be modified.
- this is similar to javascript so not going in much depth.
